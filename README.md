**📊 Performance:** Includes Python vs Rust benchmarks  
**🤖 AI-Powered:** Three strategic prompt types with detailed learning reflections

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running with Rust in under 5 minutes:

**Windows:** Run `Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://win.rustup.rs/ | Invoke-Expression` in PowerShell  
**Mac/Linux:** Run `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

Then create your first project:

```bash
# Create and run your first project
cargo new my_first_rust_app
cd my_first_rust_app
cargo run
```

## 📋 What You'll Learn

After completing this guide, you will:

- ✅ Install and configure Rust toolchain on your system
- ✅ Create and run Rust applications using Cargo
- ✅ Understand Rust's fundamental concepts (ownership, borrowing, error handling)
- ✅ Build a working CLI calculator with proper error handling
- ✅ Know how to troubleshoot common Rust issues
- ✅ Understand when to choose Rust vs other languages like Python

## 🎯 Why Rust?

**What is Rust?**
Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency. It prevents common programming errors like null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows at compile time, without requiring a garbage collector.

**Real-world Example:**
Discord uses Rust for their backend services to handle millions of concurrent users, and Dropbox rewrote their file storage system in Rust for better performance and reliability.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Platform-Specific Installation

**🪟 Windows:**

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://win.rustup.rs/ | Invoke-Expression
```

_Alternative: Download and run [rustup-init.exe](https://rustup.rs/) if you prefer GUI installation_

**🍎 macOS:**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

**🐧 Linux:**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Verify Installation

After installation, open a **new** terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
# Check versions
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

**Expected Output:**

```
rustc 1.XX.X (hash 2024-XX-XX)
cargo 1.XX.X (hash 2024-XX-XX)
```

### Having Issues?

**Windows Users:** If you get "command not found" errors:

- Make sure you opened a **new** command prompt after installation
- Check that `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` is in your PATH

**Mac/Linux Users:** Run `source ~/.cargo/env` if commands aren't found

See our **[Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** for detailed solutions.

## 📚 Complete Working Example

The calculator demonstrates key Rust concepts:

**File: `src/main.rs`**

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("🦀 Welcome to Rust Calculator!");
    println!("Enter expressions like '5 + 3' or type 'quit' to exit.");
    println!("Supported operations: +, -, *, /");
    println!();

    loop {
        print!("> ");
        io::Write::flush(&mut io::stdout()).unwrap(); // Ensure prompt appears

        let mut input = String::new();

        // Read user input
        match io::stdin().read_line(&mut input) {
            Ok(_) => {
                let input = input.trim(); // Remove whitespace

                // Check if user wants to quit
                if input.to_lowercase() == "quit" {
                    println!("Goodbye! 👋");
                    break;
                }

                // Process the calculation
                match calculate(input) {
                    Ok(result) => println!("Result: {}", result),
                    Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
                }
            }
            Err(error) => println!("Error reading input: {}", error),
        }
        println!(); // Add blank line for readability
    }
}

// Function to parse and calculate expressions
fn calculate(expression: &str) -> Result<f64, String> {
    let parts: Vec<&str> = expression.split_whitespace().collect();

    // Check if we have exactly 3 parts (number operator number)
    if parts.len() != 3 {
        return Err("Please enter in format: number operator number (e.g., '5 + 3')".to_string());
    }

    // Parse the first number
    let num1: f64 = match parts[0].parse() {
        Ok(n) => n,
        Err(_) => return Err(format!("'{}' is not a valid number", parts[0])),
    };

    // Get the operator
    let operator = parts[1];

    // Parse the second number
    let num2: f64 = match parts[2].parse() {
        Ok(n) => n,
        Err(_) => return Err(format!("'{}' is not a valid number", parts[2])),
    };

    // Perform the calculation
    match operator {
        "+" => Ok(num1 + num2),
        "-" => Ok(num1 - num2),
        "*" => Ok(num1 * num2),
        "/" => {
            if num2 == 0.0 {
                Err("Cannot divide by zero!".to_string())
            } else {
                Ok(num1 / num2)
            }
        }
        _ => Err(format!("Unknown operator '{}'. Use +, -, *, or /", operator)),
    }
}

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Learning

This project was created using AI prompts to accelerate the learning process. Key prompts used:

### Prompt 1: Technology Overview

```
I'm currently proficient in Python and want to learn Rust. Before diving into code:
1. What are the key philosophical differences between Rust and Python?
2. What problems was Rust designed to solve?
3. What mental models should I adjust coming from Python?
4. What are common misconceptions Python developers have about Rust?
```

**AI Response Summary:**
The AI provided a comprehensive comparison highlighting that Rust's ownership system eliminates the need for garbage collection by enforcing memory safety at compile time. Key insights included: Rust's "zero-cost abstractions" philosophy, the mental shift from Python's "ask forgiveness" to Rust's "permission first" approach, and how Rust's explicit error handling with `Result<T, E>` replaces Python's exception-based error handling. The AI also clarified that Rust's learning curve is steep initially but pays dividends in runtime performance and memory safety.

**What I learned:** Rust's ownership system replaces Python's garbage collector with compile-time memory management, and the borrow checker enforces memory safety rules that Python handles at runtime.

**AI Platform:** [🔗 ai.moringaschool.com](https://ai.moringaschool.com)

### Prompt 2: Documentation Strategy

**AI Platform:** [🔗 ai.moringaschool.com - Project README Generation](https://ai.moringaschool.com/ai-software/ai-use-cases/usecases-documentation/)

**AI Response Summary:**
The AI emphasized the importance of documentation hierarchy and user journey mapping. It recommended starting with a compelling "Why" section, followed by quick-start instructions for immediate gratification, then progressive complexity layers. The AI suggested using visual elements (emojis, code blocks, tables) to break up text density and provided specific strategies for cross-referencing between sections. It also highlighted the need for multiple learning paths - visual learners need examples, kinesthetic learners need hands-on exercises, and analytical learners need comprehensive references.

**What I learned:** Effective technical documentation should have modular structure, progressive disclosure of complexity, multiple entry points for different user needs, and comprehensive cross-referencing between sections.

### Prompt 3: Testing and Iteration

**AI Platform:** [🔗 ai.moringaschool.com - Test Planning Guidance](https://ai.moringaschool.com/ai-software/ai-use-cases/usecases-testing-simpler/)

**AI Response Summary:**
The AI demonstrated the Socratic method for test planning, asking probing questions like "What are the different ways this function can succeed or fail?" and "How would you verify that behavior?" Instead of providing ready-made test cases, it guided me to identify edge cases systematically - invalid inputs, boundary conditions, error states, and Rust-specific concerns like ownership and borrowing. The AI emphasized test prioritization: core functionality first, then error handling, then edge cases. It also highlighted Rust-specific testing patterns like using `Result<T, E>` assertions and testing panic conditions.

**What I learned:** This guided approach develops test planning skills, teaches methodical thinking about test cases, builds understanding of test prioritization, and creates a structured approach for testing any Rust function. Rather than generating tests automatically, this method builds critical thinking skills and helps understand the "why" behind each test case.

### Learning Reflections Summary

**Key Insights from AI-Assisted Learning:**

1. **Mental Model Shifts**: Coming from Python, the biggest challenge was understanding Rust's ownership system. AI helped bridge this gap by explaining concepts in terms of familiar Python patterns.

2. **Documentation Strategy**: Learned that effective technical documentation requires multiple entry points - quick start for impatient developers, detailed examples for hands-on learners, and comprehensive references for thorough readers.

3. **Testing Methodology**: Discovered that guided test planning is more valuable than generated test code. The Socratic method of AI questioning builds deeper understanding of edge cases and test prioritization.

4. **Iterative Learning**: AI prompts work best when they encourage active participation rather than passive consumption. Each prompt forced me to think critically about the problem before receiving guidance.
